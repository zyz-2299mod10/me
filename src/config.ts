  aboutMe:
    "I am a disciplined, conscientious, and motivated learner interested in computer science, with project and research experience in deep learning, computer vision, image processing, medical AI, and robotics.\n I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Biotechnology at NYCU and am currently pursuing a master’s degree at NTU BEBI, where my work involves medical imaging, computer vision and deep learning advised by Professor Ruey-Feng Chang in CAD Lab. My past research includes vision-based robotics and trajectory planning advised by Professor Yi-Ting Chen in Human-centered Intelligent Systems Lab.\n These experiences have strengthened my ability to break down complex problems and build practical systems through careful experimentation and collaboration.\nOutside of work, I enjoy drawing and working out.",
